# mod-assets
Assets that can be freely used for any SDV mods, simply credit the asset author when you do!


## FAQ
#### How does this work?
*At times, modders end up with assets they created for projects that got abandoned, or where the asset eventually became obsolete.
Rather then have these assets disappear into the void or sit around collecting (virtual) dust forever, modders can choose to add them to this repository for other modders to use in their work.*

#### What can these assets be used for?
*As part of the agreement accepted when a asset is uploaded here, these assets can be used by any SDV modder for any SDV mod as long as credit is given to the author of the asset.
This credit can be given through a credits.txt file that is bundled with the mod.*

#### How do I add a asset to this repository?
*For simplicity, each asset author should have their own folder (Named after their GitHub username) for all their assets.
Simply PR your assets into this folder, and if you want to clarify how people should credit you, include a readme in the folder with credit instructions.*
